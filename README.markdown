# vim-colors-m

> A color scheme for Vim inspired by iA Writer


## Features

The _m_ color scheme takes its inspiration from iA Writer, an elegant
word processor available on the iOS and OSX platforms.


## Requirements

Currently requires vim >= 7.0


## Installation

For a basic install simply copy the color scheme file to your
`~/.vim/colors` directory.
You can also use your favorite Vim package manager.


## Usage

Just like any other color scheme:

```vim
:colorscheme m
```

## Font

iA Writer uses a typeface called ‘Nitti Light’ by Blue Monday, which costs
money.
I use [Cousine](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Cousine).
